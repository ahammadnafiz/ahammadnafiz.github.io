## 🎯 About Me

I'm a passionate Data Science student with a deep fascination for AI research, particularly in **Natural Language Processing** and **Reinforcement Learning**. My journey revolves around understanding machine learning from both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

Currently, I'm diving deep into **Transformer architectures** by building them from scratch—because there's no better way to truly understand how these powerful models work under the hood.
